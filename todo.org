** TODO changes [75%]
*** TODO user levels control [0%]
     Will exist three user level/groups
     - default :: This user only can open the application in read mode
     - modify :: users that will can modify the request in the application

*** DONE changes in restrictions [100%]
     - State "DONE"       from "IN-PROGRESS" [2013-02-15 Fri 16:54]
     - [X] if Antenna in STE => Antenna in PAD
     - [X] if Antenna with Corr, Clo or Holo => Antenna in STE and PAD
*** DONE use diferent ids to know if is a new configuration or not
     - State "DONE"       from "IN-PROGRESS" [2013-02-18 Mon 17:09]
     Will be used the first column how *id*
     Now the resources used each one a particular unique key to comparted if
     this resource is in the DB or not
